Extending the classical wisdom of variance minimization in low dimensions to high-dimensional finetuning, our generalization analysis unveils the importance of additionally reducing bias induced by low-rank approximation. Inspired by the variance-bias tradeoff in high dimensions from the theory, we introduce SÌ±ketchy MÌ±oment MÌ±atching (SkMM), a scalable data selection scheme with two stages. (i) First, the bias is controlled using gradient sketching that explores the finetuning parameter space for an informative low-dimensional subspace \mathcalS; (ii) then the variance is reduced over \mathcalS via moment matching between the original and selected datasets. Theoretically, we show that gradient sketching is fast and provably accurate: selecting n samples by reducing variance over \mathcalS preserves the fast-rate generalization O(\dim(\mathcalS)/n), independent of the parameter dimension. Empirically, we concretize the variance-bias balance via synthetic experiments and demonstrate the effectiveness of SkMM for finetuning in real vision tasks.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge" style="background-color:#0048BA"><a href="https://neurips.cc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NeurIPS</a></abbr></div> <div id="phan2024enhancing" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Enhancing Domain Adaptation through Prompt Gradient Alignment</div> <div class="author"> <em>Hoang Phan*</em>,Â Lam Tran*,Â Quyen Tran*,Â andÂ Trung Le</div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems</em> 2024 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09353" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF</a> <a href="https://github.com/VietHoang1512/PGA" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Code</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Prior Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) methods often aim to train a domain-invariant feature extractor, which may hinder the model from learning sufficiently discriminative features. To tackle this, a line of works based on prompt learning leverages the power of large-scale pre-trained vision-language models to learn both domain-invariant and specific features through a set of domain-agnostic and domain-specific learnable prompts. Those studies typically enforce invariant constraints on representation, output, or prompt space to learn such prompts. Differently, we cast UDA as a multiple-objective optimization problem in which each objective is represented by a domain loss. Under this new framework, we propose aligning per-objective gradients to foster consensus between them. Additionally, to prevent potential overfitting when fine-tuning this deep learning architecture, we penalize the norm of these gradients. To achieve these goals, we devise a practical gradient update procedure that can work under both single-source and multi-source UDA.

To alleviate these problems, recent approaches leverage distributional robustness optimization (DRO) to find the most challenging distribution, and then minimize loss function over this most challenging distribution. Regardless of achieving some improvements, these DRO approaches have some obvious limitations. First, they purely focus on local regularization to strengthen model robustness, missing a global regularization effect which is useful in many real-world applications (e.g., domain adaptation, domain generalization, and adversarial machine learning). Second, the loss functions in the existing DRO approaches operate in only the most challenging distribution, hence decouple with the original distribution, leading to a restrictive modeling capability. In this paper, we propose a novel regularization technique, following the veins of Wasserstein-based DRO framework. Specifically, we define a particular joint distribution and Wasserstein-based uncertainty, allowing us to couple the original and most challenging distributions for enhancing modeling capability and applying both local and global regularizations. Empirical studies on different learning problems demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly outperforms the existing regularization approaches in various domains: semi-supervised learning, domain adaptation, domain generalization, and adversarial machine learning.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="year">2022</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge" style="background-color:#ffdddd"><a href="">Preprint</a></abbr></div> <div id="phan2022improving" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Improving Multi-task Learning via Seeking Task-based Flat Regions</div> <div class="author"> <em>Hoang Phan</em>,Â Lam Tran,Â Ngoc Tran,Â Nhat Ho,Â Dinh Phung,Â andÂ Trung Le</div> <div class="periodical"> <em>arXiv preprint arXiv:2211.13723 </em> 2022 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13723" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Multi-Task Learning (MTL) is a widely-used and powerful learning paradigm for training deep neural networks that allows learning more than one objective by a single backbone. Compared to training tasks separately, MTL significantly reduces computational costs, improves data efficiency, and potentially enhances model performance by leveraging knowledge across tasks. Hence, it has been adopted in a variety of applications, ranging from computer vision to natural language processing and speech recognition. Among them, there is an emerging line of work in MTL that focuses on manipulating the task gradient to derive an ultimate gradient descent direction to benefit all tasks. Despite achieving impressive results on many benchmarks, directly applying these approaches without using appropriate regularization techniques might lead to suboptimal solutions on real-world problems. In particular, standard training that minimizes the empirical loss on the training data can easily suffer from overfitting to low-resource tasks or be spoiled by noisy-labeled ones, which can cause negative transfer between tasks and overall performance drop. To alleviate such problems, we propose to leverage a recently introduced training method, named Sharpness-aware Minimization, which can enhance model generalization ability on single-task learning. Accordingly, we present a novel MTL training methodology, encouraging the model to find task-based flat minima for coherently improving its generalization capability on all tasks. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments on a variety of applications to demonstrate the merit of our proposed approach to existing gradient-based MTL methods, as suggested by our developed theory.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge" style="background-color:#ffdddd"><a href="">Preprint</a></abbr></div> <div id="tran2022continual" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Continual Learning with Optimal Transport based Mixture Model</div> <div class="author"> Quyen Tran,Â <em>Hoang Phan</em>,Â Khoat Than,Â Dinh Phung,Â andÂ Trung Le</div> <div class="periodical"> <em>arXiv preprint arXiv:2211.16780 </em> 2022 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16780" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Online Class Incremental learning (CIL) is a challenging setting in Continual Learning (CL), wherein data of new tasks arrive in incoming streams and online learning models need to handle incoming data streams without revisiting previous ones. Existing works used a single centroid adapted with incoming data streams to characterize a class. This approach possibly exposes limitations when the incoming data stream of a class is naturally multimodal. To address this issue, in this work, we first propose an online mixture model learning approach based on nice properties of the mature optimal transport theory (OT-MM). Specifically, the centroids and covariance matrices of the mixture model are adapted incrementally according to incoming data streams. The advantages are two-fold: (i) we can characterize more accurately complex data streams and (ii) by using centroids for each class produced by OT-MM, we can estimate the similarity of an unseen example to each class more reasonably when doing inference. Moreover, to combat the catastrophic forgetting in the CIL scenario, we further propose Dynamic Preservation. Particularly, after performing the dynamic preservation technique across data streams, the latent representations of the classes in the old and new tasks become more condensed themselves and more separate from each other. Together with a contraction feature extractor, this technique facilitates the model in mitigating the catastrophic forgetting. The experimental results on real-world datasets show that our proposed method can significantly outperform the current state-of-the-art baselines.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge" style="background-color:#0048BA"><a href="https://neurips.cc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NeurIPS</a></abbr></div> <div id="phan2022stochastic" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Stochastic Multiple Target Sampling Gradient Descent</div> <div class="author"> <em>Hoang Phan</em>,Â Ngoc Tran,Â Trung Le,Â Toan Tran,Â Nhat Ho,Â andÂ Dinh Phung</div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems </em> 2022 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01934" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF</a> <a href="https://github.com/VietHoang1512/MT-SGD" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Code</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Sampling from an unnormalized target distribution is an essential problem with many applications in probabilistic inference. Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) has been shown to be a powerful method that iteratively updates a set of particles to approximate the distribution of interest. Furthermore, when analysing its asymptotic properties, SVGD reduces exactly to a single-objective optimization problem and can be viewed as a probabilistic version of this single-objective optimization problem. A natural question then arises: "Can we derive a probabilistic version of the multi-objective optimization?". To answer this question, we propose Stochastic Multiple Target Sampling Gradient Descent (MT-SGD), enabling us to sample from multiple unnormalized target distributions. Specifically, our MT-SGD conducts a flow of intermediate distributions gradually orienting to multiple target distributions, which allows the sampled particles to move to the joint high-likelihood region of the target distributions. Interestingly, the asymptotic analysis shows that our approach reduces exactly to the multiple-gradient descent algorithm for multi-objective optimization, as expected.

This also poses a central difficulty in the field of CL, termed as Catastrophic Forgetting (CF). In an attempt to address this problem, Bayesian methods provide a powerful principle, focusing on the inference scheme to estimate the importance of weights. Variational inference (VI), one of the most widely used methods within this vein, approximates the intractable posterior by a factorized distribution, thus offering computational efficiency. Notwithstanding many state-of-the-art performances in practice, this simple assumption about the posterior distribution typically limits the model capacity to some extent. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to mitigate forgetting in the Bayesian approach via enriching the posterior distribution with mixture models, which intuitively promotes neural networks to acquire knowledge from multiple tasks at a time. Moreover, in order to reduce the modelâ€™s complexity growth when the number of components increases, we propose a solution that conducts low-rank decomposition on the variance of each component based on neural matrix factorization. Extensive experiments show that our method yields significant improvements compared to prior works on different benchmarks.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="year">2021</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge" style="background-color:#F29105"><a href="https://aclanthology.org/venues/emnlp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EMNLP</a></abbr></div> <div id="phan2021matching" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Matching the statements: A simple and accurate model for key point analysis</div> <div class="author"> <em>Hoang Phan</em>,Â Long Nguyen,Â andÂ Khanh Doan</div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Proceedings of the 8th Workshop on Argument Mining </em> 2021 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://aclanthology.org/2021.argmining-1.17/" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF</a> <a href="https://github.com/VietHoang1512/KPA" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Code</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Key Point Analysis (KPA) is one of the most essential tasks in building an Opinion Summarization system, which is capable of generating key points for a collection of arguments toward a particular topic. Furthermore, KPA allows quantifying the coverage of each summary by counting its matched arguments. With the aim of creating high-quality summaries, it is necessary to have an in-depth understanding of each individual argument as well as its universal semantic in a specified context. In this paper, we introduce a promising model, named Matching the Statements (MTS) that incorporates the discussed topic information into arguments/key points comprehension to fully understand their meanings, thus accurately performing ranking and retrieving best-match key points for an input argument. Our approach has achieved the 4th place in Track 1 of the Quantitative Summarization â€“ Key Point Analysis Shared Task by IBM, yielding a competitive performance of 0.8956 (3rd) and 0.9632 (7th) strict and relaxed mean Average Precision, respectively.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge" style="background-color:#B284BE"><a href="https://cvpr.thecvf.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CVPR</a></abbr></div> <div id="nguyen2021contrastive" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Contrastive learning for natural language-based vehicle retrieval</div> <div class="author"> Tam Nguyen,Â Quang Pham,Â Linh Doan,Â Hoang Trinh,Â Anh Nguyen,Â andÂ <em>Hoang Phan</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops </em> 2021 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021W/AICity/html/Nguyen_Contrastive_Learning_for_Natural_Language-Based_Vehicle_Retrieval_CVPRW_2021_paper.html" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF</a> <a href="https://github.com/VietHoang1512/CVPR-track-5" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Code</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>AI City Challenge 2021 Task 5: The Natural Language-Based Vehicle Tracking is a Natural Language-based Vehicle Retrieval task, which requires retrieving a single-camera track using a set of three natural language descriptions of the specific targets.
